Todo list for ZappSpy & ZapSpyGui:

Fix inherent race condition in CpDeviceList callbacks.
Fix unnecessary race condition in UpnpDeviceFinder between construction and event registration.
Track down access violations(!)
Review all the parsing code for robustness to bad XML and/or missing fields.
Determine if defaultss.txt can be used legally or needs to be replaced.

    )
Parse out icon information.
Render appropriate icons in tree view.
Sort tree view.
Group state variables in their own folder in the tree view.
Parse out versin information for devices.
Test with embedded devices.
Show property data for actions and variables.
Rename ZapSpyGui to ZappSpyGui
Check that ZappSpy and ZappSpyGui projects are in the correct folders. (I think one is at the wrong level.)
